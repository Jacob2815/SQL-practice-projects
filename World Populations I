--Project Goals
--You’ll work with a dataset of world population by country data from recent years. You’ll write queries to retrieve interesting data and answer a set of specific questions.

-- This is the first query:

SELECT DISTINCT year from population_years;

-- Add your additional queries below:

--What is the largest population size for Gabon in this dataset?

SELECT MAX(population) FROM population_years WHERE country = 'Gabon';

--What were the 10 lowest population countries in 2005?

SELECT country from population_years WHERE year = 2005 ORDER BY population ASC LIMIT 10;

--What are all the distinct countries with a population of over 100 million in the year 2010?

SELECT country from population_years WHERE population > 100 AND year = 2010;

--How many countries in this dataset have the word “Islands” in their name?

SELECT DISTINCT country from population_years WHERE country LIKE '%islands%';

--What is the difference in population between 2000 and 2010 in Indonesia?

SELECT * from population_years WHERE country = 'Indonesia' AND (year = 2000 OR year = 2010);
